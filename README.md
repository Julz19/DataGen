# Datagen

This repository contains simple code to get started with generating high-quality synthetic data using LLMs provided documentation.

**NOTE:** The current state of the script **DOES NOT** handle output parsing situations, meaning user and assistant completions will contain '<user></user>', '<assistant></assistant>' tags within them. o ensure a proper clean generation, please handle this parsing and cleaning accordingly.

This is **NOT** meant to be used in production applications and instead is to be seen as more of a starting point for beginners or as a research point into synthetic data generation.
